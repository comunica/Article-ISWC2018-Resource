## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Linked Open Data cloud keeps growing, and so does the number of different types of Linked Data retrieval interfaces.
Such interfaces include raw data dumps, SPARQL endpoints, TPF entrypoints, and variants.
In order to query the Linked Data that is contained in all of these different source types,
<!-- Need         -->
there is a need for an engine that is able to query over such heterogeneous interfaces,
and where new kinds of interfaces can be tested for research-purposes.
<!-- Task         -->
As such, we designed and developed a Web-friendly and modular engine that is able to perform federated querying over heterogeneous sources.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article, we introduce this engine --called _Comunica_-- and discuss its architecture.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Comunica is the first system that is able to query over heterogeneous Linked Data interfaces.
Its modular nature makes it the ideal research platform for investigating new kinds of Linked Data interfaces and querying algorithms.
